# Perceptron

This repository contains code for a Perceptron classification algorithm created as part of Assignment 3 of the CT475 Module - Machine Learning and Data Mining, at NUI Galway.

The implementation of the algorithm is "from scratch" as per the assignment specifications. The purpose of the classification algorithm is to distinguish between three types of owl: Barn Owl, Snowy Owl, and Long-Eared Owl.

The data used is contained in the data folder, with the src folder containing the Perceptron code.
